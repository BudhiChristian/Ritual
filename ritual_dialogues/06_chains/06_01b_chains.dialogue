Dr. Gast Lee\: There it is! The chains weighing down this teddy bear.
Dr. Gast Lee\: These spirits are so tightly coupled to the host that they lock them selves in place.
Yakisoba Nudol\: What can we do?
Dr. Gast Lee\: Luckily the thurible will reveal these spirits automatically, but you will need to use your pin sets to surround the locks on the chains.
Dr. Gast Lee\: The triangle ritual will temporarily release the locks, which should give you enough time to capture the spirits with your dagger.
Yakisoba Nudol\: Okay, I'll form a ritual around those locks!
