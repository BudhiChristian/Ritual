Dr. Ecto\: Oh yeah! I forgot to mention...
Dr. Ecto\: You see how that ritual triangle disappeared?
Dr. Ecto\: That means the ritual is over and you can pick the needles back up to create a new triangle.

(Right-click on a needle to pull it off of the body. All needles in a set need to be retrieved before starting a new ritual triangle.)
