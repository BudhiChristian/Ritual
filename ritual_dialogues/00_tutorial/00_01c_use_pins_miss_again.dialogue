Yakisoba Nudol\: ...[wait=1]... [wait=1]So either we need to chant, or you didn't charge those needles.
Dr. Gast Lee\: You don't need to chant!
Dr. Gast Lee\: Let's try this again. You can pull the needles off of Mx. Yonce and form a new triangle.
Dr. Gast Lee\: Just take care not to yank them out before the ritual is complete, otherwise the you'll damage their soul.
(Right-click on a needle to pull it off of the body. All needles in a set need to be retrieved before starting a new ritual triangle.)
