Yakisoba Nudol\: That's new!
Dr. Gast Lee\: Oh yes! This little fella's is one of Asmodeous' servants.
Yakisoba Nudol\: Hope you're not allegic to peanuts.
Dr. Gast Lee\: I've clean those jars well.
Servant of Asmodeus\: Thank you!
Dr. Gast Lee\: Just one more thing to note. Soul jars can only hold one color of spirit at a time. A spirit of a different color will just return to the body if the jar has another spirit already.
Yakisoba Nudol\: So this really is match three.
Dr. Gast Lee\: More like there's in fighting within the ranks of spirits.
Yakisoba Nudol\: Seems more like a race issue...
